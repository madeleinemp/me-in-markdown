## Introduction

Hi! My name is Madeleine Martinez Park. I am currently in 10th grade and playing soccer. My favorite book is "Crying in H-Mart". 

This summer my family and I went to the Redwoods National Park and went to the nearby Fern Canyon which was byfar my favorite summer memory. 

My favorite food that I enjoyed this summer was tteok guk (a Korean rice cake soup), it is memorable to me because in Korean culture eating this soup would give you "good luck" for the year.
